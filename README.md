## 1. What's Duix.Avatar

**Duix.Avatar** is a free and open-source AI avatar project developed by **Duix.com**.

Seven years ago, a group of young pioneers chose an unconventional technical path, developing a method to train digital human models using real-person video data. Unlike traditional costly 3D digital human approaches, we leveraged AI-generated technology to create ultra-realistic digital humans, slashing production costs from hundreds of thousands of dollars to just $1,000. This innovation has empowered over 10,000 enterprises and generated over 500,000 personalized avatars for professionals across fields – educators, content creators, legal experts, medical practitioners, and entrepreneurs – dramatically enhancing their video production efficiency. However, our vision extends beyond commercial applications. We believe this transformative technology should be accessible to everyone. To democratize digital human creation, we've open-sourced our cloning technology and video production framework. Our commitment remains: breaking down technological barriers to make cutting-edge tools available to all. Now, anyone with a computer can freely craft their own AI Avatar and produce videos at zero cost – this is the essence of  **Duix.Avatar**.

## 2. Introduction

![img](README.assets/2.png)

Duix.Avatar is a fully offline video synthesis tool designed for Windows systems that can precisely clone your appearance and voice, digitalizing your image. You can create videos by driving virtual avatars through text and voice. No internet connection is required, protecting your privacy while enjoying convenient and efficient digital experiences.

- Core Features
  - Precise Appearance and Voice Cloning: Using advanced AI algorithms to capture human facial features with high precision, including facial features, contours, etc., to build realistic virtual models. It can also precisely clone voices, capturing and reproducing subtle characteristics of human voices, supporting various voice parameter settings to create highly similar cloning effects.
  - Text and Voice-Driven Virtual Avatars: Understanding text content through natural language processing technology, converting text into natural and fluent speech to drive virtual avatars. Voice input can also be used directly, allowing virtual avatars to perform corresponding actions and facial expressions based on the rhythm and intonation of the voice, making the virtual avatar's performance more natural and vivid.
  - Efficient Video Synthesis: Highly synchronizing digital human video images with sound, achieving natural and smooth lip-syncing, intelligently optimizing audio-video synchronization effects.
  - Multi-language Support: Scripts support eight languages - English, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, French, German, Arabic, and Spanish.
- Key Advantages
  - Fully Offline Operation: No internet connection required, effectively protecting user privacy, allowing users to create in a secure, independent environment, avoiding potential data leaks during network transmission.
  - User-Friendly: Clean and intuitive interface, easy to use even for beginners with no technical background, quickly mastering the software's usage to start their digital human creation journey.
  - Multiple Model Support: Supports importing multiple models and managing them through one-click startup packages, making it convenient for users to choose suitable models based on different creative needs and application scenarios.
- Technical Support
  - Voice Cloning Technology: Using advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to generate similar or identical voices based on given voice samples, covering context, intonation, speed, and other aspects of speech.
  - Automatic Speech Recognition: Technology that converts human speech vocabulary content into computer-readable input (text format), enabling computers to "understand" human speech.
  - Computer Vision Technology: Used in video synthesis for visual processing, including facial recognition and lip movement analysis, ensuring virtual avatar lip movements match voice and text content.



## 3. How to Run Locally

Duix.Avatar supports Docker-based rapid deployment. Prior to deployment, ensure your hardware and software environments meet the specified requirements.

Duix.Avatar support two deployment modes：Windows / Ubuntu 22.04 Installation

### **Dependencies**

  > NVIDIA driver download link: https://www.nvidia.cn/drivers/lookup/

  ![img](./README.assets/14.png)


#### **Installing Windows Docker**

1. Use the command `wsl --list --verbose` to check if WSL is installed. If it shows as below, it's already installed and no further installation is needed.

    ![img](README.assets/11.png)



2. Update WSL using `wsl --update`.

    ![img](README.assets/10.png)

3. [Download Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/), choose the appropriate installation package based on your CPU architecture.
4. When you see this interface, installation is successful.

    ![img](README.assets/5.png)

5. Run Docker

    ![img](README.assets/12.png)

6. Accept the agreement and skip login on first run

    ![img](README.assets/8.png)

    ![img](README.assets/13.png)

    ![img](README.assets/3.png)


#### **Installing the Server**

Installation using Docker, docker-compose as follows:

1. The `docker-compose.yml` file is in the `/deploy` directory.
2. Execute `docker-compose up -d` in the `/deploy` directory, if you want to use the lite version, execute `docker-compose -f docker-compose-lite.yml up -d`
3. Wait patiently (about half an hour, speed depends on network), download will consume about 70GB of traffic, make sure to use WiFi
4. When you see three services in Docker, it indicates success (the lite version has only one service `Duix.Avatar-gen-video`)

    ![img](README.assets/6.png)

#### **Choosing a Client: Desktop App or Web Application**

Once the server (backend) services are running, you can interact with Duix.Avatar through **either** of two clients — pick whichever suits you:

| Option | Best for | How it runs |
| ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| **Desktop App** (Electron) | Single-machine use with a native installer | Download and install the prebuilt package (see [Client](#client) below) |
| **Web Application** (browser client) | Accessing Duix.Avatar from any device on your network via a browser | Runs as a Docker container (see [Web Application](#web-application) below) |

Both clients provide the same core workflow (create an avatar, synthesize videos). The web application is a browser-based replacement for the desktop app that runs as an additional container.

> **Important:** The web application must run in the **same Docker environment as the backend services** (or on a host with access to the same shared data volume). The backend containers exchange media by shared file path rather than HTTP upload, so the web container must mount the **same `duix_avatar_data` directory** the backend containers use. The browser itself can connect from anywhere on the network.

#### **Server Deployment Solution for NVIDIA 50 Series Graphics Cards**

For 50 series graphics cards (tested and also works for 30/40 series with CUDA 12.8) Uses the official preview version of PyTorch

#### **Client**

1. Directly download the [officially built installation package](https://github.com/duixcom/Duix.Avatar/releases)
2. Double-click `Duix.Avatar-x.x.x-setup.exe` to install

#### **Web Application**

Instead of (or in addition to) the desktop app, you can run the browser-based web client as a Docker container. It must run in the **same Docker environment as the backend services** and mount the **same shared data volume**, because the backend containers exchange media by file path.

1. Configure and start the web container:

   ```bash
   cd web
   cp .env.example .env          # edit DUIX_SERVER_HOST + DUIX_DATA_DIR
   docker compose -f docker-compose.web.yml up -d --build
   ```

   - `DUIX_SERVER_HOST` — IP/hostname of the machine running the backend containers.
   - `DUIX_DATA_DIR` — the host path the backend `docker-compose` mounts as its data volume (e.g. `d:/duix_avatar_data` on Windows). This **must be the same directory** the backend uses; it contains the `face2face/` and `voice/` subfolders.
   - `WEB_PORT` — the port the UI is published on (default `8080`).

2. Open `http://<host-ip>:8080` in a browser from any device on the network. You can also set/override the backend server IP at runtime from the in-app **Settings** page.

> For full details, environment variables, local dev instructions, and the BFF REST API, see [`web/README.md`](web/README.md).

### Mode 2：Ubuntu 22.04 Installation

**System Requirements：**

We have conducted a complete test on **Ubuntu 22.04**. However, theoretically, it supports desktop Linux distributions.

**Hardware Requirements：**

- Recommended Configuration
- CPU: 13th Generation Intel Core i5 - 13400F
- Memory: 32G or more (necessary)
- Graphics Card: RTX - 4070 (Ensure you have an NVIDIA graphics card and the graphics card driver is correctly installed)
- Hard Disk: Free space greater than 100G

**Install Docker:**

First, use` docker --version` to check if Docker is installed. If it is installed, skip the following steps.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

**Install the graphics card driver:**

1. Install the graphics card driver by referring to the official documentation(https://www.nvidia.cn/drivers/lookup/).

After installation, execute the `nvidia-smi` command. If the graphics card information is displayed, the installation is successful.

2. Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit

​    The NVIDIA Container Toolkit is a necessary tool for Docker to use NVIDIA GPUs. The installation steps are as follows:

- Add the NVIDIA package repository:

```
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID) \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add - \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/$distribution/libnvidia-container.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
```

- Update the package list and install the toolkit:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
```

- Configure Docker to use the NVIDIA runtime:

```
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
```

- Restart the Docker service:

```
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

#### **Install the server**

```
cd /deploy
docker-compose -f docker-compose-linux.yml up -d
```

#### **Install the client**

You can use **either** the desktop app or the web application (see [Choosing a Client](#choosing-a-client-desktop-app-or-web-application) above).

**Option A — Desktop App:**

1. Directly download the Linux version of the [officially built installation package](https://github.com/duixcom/Duix.Avatar/releases).
2. Double click `Duix.Avatar-x.x.x.AppImage` to launch it. No installation is required.

Reminder: In the Ubuntu system, if you enter the desktop as the `root` user, directly double - clicking `Duix.Avatar - x.x.x.AppImage` may not work. You need to execute `./Duix.Avatar - x.x.x.AppImage --no - sandbox` in the command - line terminal. Adding the `--no - sandbox` parameter will do the trick.

**Option B — Web Application (Docker):**

Run the browser-based client as a container in the **same Docker environment as the backend services**, mounting the **same shared data volume**:

```bash
cd web
cp .env.example .env          # edit DUIX_SERVER_HOST + DUIX_DATA_DIR
docker compose -f docker-compose.web.yml up -d --build
```

Then open `http://<host-ip>:8080` in a browser. Set `DUIX_DATA_DIR` to the same directory the backend `docker-compose` mounts (containing the `face2face/` and `voice/` subfolders). See [`web/README.md`](web/README.md) for full details.



## 4. Open APIs
